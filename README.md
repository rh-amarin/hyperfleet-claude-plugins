A collection of Claude plugins for the HyperFleet team, exposed as a Claude plugin marketplace.

## Documentation

- [Claude Plugins Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins)
- [Claude Plugin Marketplaces Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugin-marketplaces)

## Using this Marketplace

### Within Claude Code
Optionally, use the `/plugin` slash command without any options for a simplified interactive experience.

To install the marketplace:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-claude-plugins
```

Install a plugin:
```bash
/plugin install <plugin-name>@openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-claude-plugins
```

**Note:** After installing a plugin, restart Claude Code to load it.

## Updating your Plugins

All plugins connected to this marketplace (commands, agents, skills, etc) must be updated manually within the Claude interface.

```
/plugin marketplace update hyperfleet-claude-plugins
```

Running this command within your Claude prompt will automatically refresh and update all plugins you've installed from the hyperfleet-claude-plugins marketplace!
